            <p>In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), the spleen and stomach are considered essential for digestion. The
                spleen is believed to play a central role in transforming food into Qi (energy) and blood, while the
                stomach is responsible for breaking down food.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Chinese yam is considered a spleen and stomach tonic in TCM.</li>
                <li>Hawthorn fruit increases the total acidity and total output of gastric juice. It also improves
                    gastrointestinal peristalsis.</li>
                <li>Germinated barley has cooling properties in TCM, meaning it can help soothe the stomach and reduce
                    stomach heat. It is often recommended for conditions where excess heat or irritation in the
                    digestive tract contributes to indigestion symptoms like acid reflux, heartburn, or nausea. This
                    cooling effect can help bring balance to the digestive system, promoting smoother digestion and
                    reducing discomfort.</li>
