            <p>Vitamin C and phytochemicals in blueberry have immune-boosting, anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, and
                antiviral properties. This product may help reduce the severity and duration of flu symptoms, including
                sore throat, fatigue, fever, and congestion.
                Dehydration is a common concern when you're suffering from the flu, especially due to
                symptoms like fever, sweating, nasal congestion, and vomiting or diarrhea. The flu can increase the risk
                of dehydration for several reasons, and it's important to address this to help your body recover
                effectively.

            </p>
            <p>Vitamin C and anthocyanins battle against the viruses through the following
                mechanisms:</p>
            <ol>
                <li style="color: rgb(178, 28, 183);">Enhances White Blood Cells</li>
                <p class="line2">Vitamin C increases the production and function of while blood cells (e.g.,
                    neutrophils,
                    lymphocytes), which are crucial for fighting infections like the flu.</p>
                <li style="color: rgb(178, 28, 183);">Improves Phagocytosis</li>
                <p class="line2">It aids in the ability of immune cells to engulf and destroy flu-causing viruses.</p>
                <li style="color: rgb(178, 28, 183);">Promotes Cytokine Balance</li>
                <p class="line2">By regulating cytokine production, vitamin C helps the immune system respond
                    effectively without
                    triggering excessive inflammation.</p>
                <li style="color: rgb(178, 28, 183);">Reduces Inflammation</li>
                <p class="line2">Vitamin C lowers the production of
                    pro-inflammatory compounds that can worsen flu symptoms like fever, muscle aches, and fatigue.
                </p>
                <li style="color: rgb(178, 28, 183);">Speeds Wound Healing</li>
                <p class="line2">By promoting collagen synthesis, vitamin C supports the repair of damaged tissues,
                    including those
                    affected by inflammation during the flu.</p>
