            <p>Enzymes extracted from varieties of fruits and vegetables help with the digestion.
                The blueberry powder helps improve gut health,
                which is crucial for digestion. Its high fiber content feeds beneficial bacteria in the gut, promoting a
                healthy balance of gut microbiota. </p>
            <p>A healthy gut microbiome can:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Aid in digestion and nutrient absorption: Good gut bacteria break down food particles that the
                    human digestive enzymes cannot digest on their own, helping the body absorb more nutrients.</li>
                <li>Alleviate digestive discomfort: A balanced gut
                    flora can reduce symptoms like bloating, gas, and indigestion. Blueberries have been shown to
                    support the growth of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria, which are known for their digestive
                    benefits.
