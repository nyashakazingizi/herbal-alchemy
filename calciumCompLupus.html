            <p>People with lupus are at increased risk for osteoporosis and bone loss, partly due to the use of
                corticosteroids, which can deplete bone density. Besides, due to skin damage, they are not supposed to
                be exposed to direct sunshine. Ensuring adequate intake of vitamin D and calcium is essential for bone
                health.
                Both Calcium Capsule and Compound Marrow Powder
                contain calcium and vitamin D, which help enhance bone health in people with lupus.
                Compound Calcium Nutrient Powder for Adults/Children are featured with high absorption rate and low risk
                of inducing calcification in soft tissues.
