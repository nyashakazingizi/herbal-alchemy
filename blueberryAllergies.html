            <p>Blueberries can help improve allergies due to their high content of antioxidants, vitamins, and bioactive
                compounds that support the immune system and reduce inflammation.

            </p>
            <ol>
                <li style="color: rgb(34 169 50);" class="line2">Anti-inflammatory Properties</li>
                <p class="line2">Blueberries are one of the richest sources of flavonoids, particularly quercetin and
                    anthocyanins,
                    which have potent antioxidant properties.</p>
                <p class="line2">Quercetin: A natural antihistamine that stabilizes mast cells (a type of white blood
                    cells,
                    specificallya type of granulocyte, found in connective tissues throughout the body), preventing the
                    release
                    of histamines that cause allergy symptoms such as sneezing, itching, and congestion.
                <p class="line2">Anthocyanins: Reduce oxidative stress and inflammation, which are often elevated in
                    allergic
                    responses.</p>
                <li style="color: rgb(34 169 50);">Gut Health and Allergies</li>
                <p class="line2">Blueberry Super Nutrition is rich in fiber and acts as a prebiotic, supporting a
                    healthy gut
                    microbiome.</p>
                <p class="line2">A well-balanced gut microbiome is linked to a reduced risk of allergies, as it plays a
                    critical role
                    in modulating the immune system and its responses to allergens.</p>
