            <ul>
                <li>Protein is essential for the production of neurotransmitters like dopamine and norepinephrine,
                    which are involved in attention, focus, and impulse control.</li>
                <li>Complex carbohydrates in this product provide a steady supply of glucose to the brain, helping to
                    maintain focus and energy levels.</li>
                <li>Vitamin B complex is involved in neurotransmitter synthesis and brain function. Vitamin B6 is
                    important for the production of dopamine, a neurotransmitter crucial for focus and attention. Folate
                    (B9) is involved in brain development, and B12 helps with the maintenance of healthy nerve cells.
                </li>
                <li>Vitamin C and vitamin E are antioxidants that protect the

                    brain from oxidative stress, which can contribute to neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment.
                </li>
                <li>Iron plays a crucial role in the dopamine system, and iron deficiency has been associated with
                    ADHD-like symptoms, particularly in children.</li>
                <li>Zinc is involved in the regulation of dopamine and norepinephrine, and some studies have
                    found that children with ADHD may have lower levels of zinc. Supplementing with zinc has shown
                    potential to improve attention and reduce hyperactivity in some individuals with ADHD.
                </li>
                <li>Magnesium is essential for nerve function and helps regulate dopamine receptors in the brain. It
                    is also involved in the relaxation of muscles and can help reduce symptoms of restlessness and
                    hyperactivity often seen in ADHD.</li>
