            <p>Omega-3 fatty acids, particularly EPA and DHA, can increase the body's ability to oxidize fat, meaning
                they help the body burn fat more efficiently.
                Omega-3s can influence the storage of fat by altering the activity of certain genes involved in fat
                metabolism. They can reduce the accumulation of fat in adipose tissue (body fat) by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="line2">Increasing the activity of enzymes that help break
                    down fat.
                </li>
                <li class="line2">Reducing the activity of enzymes that promote fat storage.</li>
                <li class="line2">Supporting the function of mitochondria (the
                    energy-producing parts of cells), which helps in burning fat more effectively.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Omega-3 fatty acids can improve insulin sensitivity, which is key for managing blood sugar levels and fat
                storage. Better insulin sensitivity helps the body more effectively use glucose for energy, rather than
                store excess glucose as fat.</p>
