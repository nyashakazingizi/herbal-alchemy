                Eye strain, also known as asthenopia, is a common condition that occurs when your eyes get tired from
                intense use. It's often not a serious condition, but it can be annoying and uncomfortable. The primary
                cause of eye strain is prolonged and intense use of your eyes without adequate rest. This can be due to
                a variety of factors:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Digital screens:</b>Staring at computer monitors, smartphones, tablets, and gaming consoles for
                    long periods is a very common cause of eye strain. This is sometimes called "digital eye strain" or
                    "computer vision syndrome." When you look at screens, you tend to blink less, which can lead to dry
                    eyes.</li>
                <li><b>Reading:</b>Focusing on a book or other printed material for a long time without breaks can also
                    strain your eyes.</li>
                <li><b>Driving:</b>Driving long distances requires continuous focus, which can lead to eye fatigue.</li>
                <li><b>Poor lighting:</b>Trying to read or focus in very dim light, or being exposed to bright light or
                    glare, can make your eyes work harder and cause strain.</li>
                <li><b>Uncorrected vision problems:</b>If you have an underlying issue like nearsightedness,
                    farsightedness, or astigmatism that isn't corrected with glasses or contacts, your eye muscles will
                    strain to focus, leading to fatigue.</li>
            </ul>
