            <p>Propolis contains compounds like flavonoids and phenolic acids, which have demonstrated strong
                antibacterial properties. These compounds can help fight the bacteria that cause infections, including
                those responsible for dental abscesses. By inhibiting the growth of harmful bacteria, propolis may help
                prevent the abscess from worsening or spreading.
            </p>
            <p>You can open 2 capsules and dilute propolis in a glass of water and use it as a mouth rinse. Swish it
                around the affected area for 30 seconds to a minute, up to 2-3 times a day. This can help reduce
                bacteria and inflammation in the mouth.
                Some people apply the propolis directly to the gums around the abscess. It can be gently massaged into
                the swollen gum area.
