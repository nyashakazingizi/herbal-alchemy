            <p>
                Drinking Blueberry Juice (High VC) helps us stay hydrated. Proper hydration is essential for diluting
                urine and flushing out minerals that could otherwise form stones.
            </p>
            <p>
                Blueberries contain natural citric acid, which may help prevent the formation of certain types of
                stones, such as calcium oxalate and uric acid stones. Citrate binds to calcium in the urine, reducing
                the risk of crystal formation.

            </p>
            <p>Blueberries are rich in antioxidants, especially anthocyanins, which may reduce oxidative stress and
                inflammation in the kidneys. These properties can help protect kidney tissues from damage caused by
                kidney stones or other kidney-related issues.</p>
