            <p>Chitosan can bind to fats and some toxins in the digestive system. Though this is more related to fat
                absorption, it may help support kidney function by reducing overall waste buildup, which could help the
                kidneys process uric acid more efficiently.

            </p>
            <p>High levels of uric acid are often linked to insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome, which can also
                affect cholesterol levels. Since chitosan has been shown to help reduce cholesterol levels, it may
                indirectly improve overall metabolic health / and reduce risk factors associated with gout.</p>
