                Omega-3 fatty acids have strong
                anti-inflammatory properties. Chronic inflammation in the airways is a key factor in asthma, and
                omega-3s can help reduce this inflammation, potentially improving breathing and reducing the frequency
                of asthma attacks.

                <p class="line2">DHA is a major structural component of the brain, eyes, and nervous system. Adequate
                    intake of DHA during pregnancy supports brain development and visual acuity in the baby, and may
                    contribute to improved cognitive function and visual development later in life.</p>
                <li style="color:rgb(29, 81, 204)">Reduces the Risk of Preterm Birth </li>
                <p class="line2">Research suggests that omega-3s, particularly DHA, may reduce the risk of preterm
                    birth. Some studies have found that omega-3 supplementation can help lower the incidence of early
                    delivery and improve the length of gestation.</p>
                <li style="color:rgb(29, 81, 204)">Improves Maternal Health</li>
                <p class="line2">Omega-3s can help prevent gestational hypertension and preeclampsia, conditions that
                    can occur during pregnancy and pose risks to both themother and baby. Omega-3s promote healthy blood
                    now and reduce inflammation, which are key factors in preventing these complications.</p>
                <li style="color:rgb(29, 81, 204)">Supports Postpartum Recovery</li>
                <p class="line2">Omega-3s continue to play a role after birth by supporting postpartum recovery. They
                    can help reduce the risk of postpartum depression (PPD), as omega-3s have been shown to affect mood
                    regulation and brain health. They also help repair tissue and promote breast milk production, as DHA
                    is an important component of breast milk.</p>
