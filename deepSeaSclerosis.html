            <p>Cordyceps is known to have
                anti-inflammatory properties, which could potentially help in reducing the neuroinflammation associated
                with MS.
            </p>
            <p>One of the most well-known benefits of Cordyceps is its ability to increase energy levels and combat
                fatigue, which is a common and often debilitating symptom of MS. Some studies suggest that Cordyceps can
                improve exercise endurance and physical stamina, possibly by increasing oxygen utilization and improving
                mitochondrial function.</p>
            <p>While MS-related fatigue is more complex, some people with MS may find Cordyceps helpful for improving
                energy and reducing tiredness.</p>
