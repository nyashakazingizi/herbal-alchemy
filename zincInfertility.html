                    Supports Estrogen and Progesterone Production
                </li>
                <p class="line2">Zinc is involved in the production and regulation of estrogen and progesterone, two of
                    the primary hormones responsible for the menstrual cycle and reproductive health.
                </p>
                <li>
                    Enhances Fertility and Reproductive Health </li>
                <p class="line2">Zinc is crucial for female fertility due
                    to its role in ovarian function and the regulation of reproductive hormones.
                </p>
                <p class="line2">Zinc is involved in the maturation of eggs in the ovaries and helps maintain healthy
                    follicular development, which is essential for successful ovulation.
                </p>
                <p class="line2">In addition to its role in egg quality, zinc supports the health of the endometrial
                    lining, ensuring it is prepared to support implantation.
                </p>
                <p class="line2">Zinc deficiency has been linked to anovulation
                    (lack of ovulation) and reduced fertility, as well as increased risk of miscarriage.
