            <p>Spirulina is about 60-70% protein by weight, making it an excellent source of plant-based protein, which
                is essential for muscle repair, energy production, and overall vitality.

            </p>
            <p>Vitamin B1, B3, B6 and B12 play a key role in cellular metabolism and ATP production, the body's primary
                energy source. In particular, vitamin B12 helps prevent anemia (a common cause of fatigue), and B6
                supports the metabolism of proteins and carbohydrates.
            </p>
            <p>Spirulina is a good source of non-heme iron, which is crucial for the production of hemoglobin and the
                transport of oxygen in the blood. Iron deficiency can lead to anemia, a common cause of fatigue.

            </p>
            <p>Magnesium plays an important role in energy production by helping convert food into energy. It also
                supports muscle function and relaxation, preventing fatigue related to muscle weakness and cramping.
