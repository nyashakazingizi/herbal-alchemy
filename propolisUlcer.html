            <p>Propolis has been shown to support gastric mucosa! healing, which is essential for repairing damage
                caused by ulcers. Studies have suggested that propolis can stimulate the production of mucous in the
                stomach. This mucus layer acts as a protective barrier that shields the stomach lining from gastric acid
                and other harmful substances, which are major contributors to ulcer formation and progression.

            </p>
            <p>Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is one of the main causes of gastric ulcers, as the bacteria
                disrupt the stomach lining and increase acid secretion. Propolis has shown antibacterial properties in
                laboratory studies, and some research suggests that it may help inhibit the growth of H. pylori in the
                stomach.
                Propolis serves as a complementary therapy alongside antibiotics, potentially helping to eradicate the
                bacteria more effectively and reduce the risk of ulcer recurrence.
