                <li style="color:rgb(17, 147, 227);"><b>Anti-inflammatory Effect </b></li>
                <p class="line2">Obesity is often associated with low-grade chronic inflammation, which can promote fat
                    storage and disrupt metabolic processes. Omega-3 fatty acids, particularly EPA and DHA have strong
                    anti-inflammatory properties. By reducing inflammation, omega-3s help alleviate insulin resistance,
                    lower fat accumulation, and improve overall metabolic health.
                </p>
                <li style="color:rgb(17, 147, 227);"><b>Improve insulin sensitivity</b></li>
                <p class="line2">Insulin resistance is common in individuals with obesity, making it harder for the body
                    to regulate blood sugar levels and store fat efficiently. Omega-3 fatty acids improve insulin
                    sensitivity by reducing the resistance of cells to insulin, thus helping the body use glucose and
                    fat more effectively. This leads to better control over blood sugar and fat storage, supporting
                    weight loss efforts.</p>
                <li style="color:rgb(17, 147, 227);"><b>Enhance fat metabolism</b></li>
                <p class="line2">Omega-3s increase the body's ability to burn fat for energy. They stimulate lipid
                    oxidation-the process by which fat is broken down and used as energy. This can help reduce fat
                    stores in the body and promote weight loss.</p>
