            <p class="line2">One of the most well-known benefits of blueberries, particularly for eye health, is their
                potential to
                improve night vision.
                The antioxidants in blueberries, especially anlhocyanins, help improve blood flow and strengthen the
                capillaries in the eyes. This enhanced circulation helps deliver essential nutrients and oxygen to the
                retina, which may improve overall eye function and slow down the progression of certain eye disorders,
                including diabetic retinopathy and macular degeneration.</p>
            <p class="line2">The high concentration of vitamin C, vitamin E, and zinc in blueberries helps protect the
                retina
                from oxidative damage. Blueberries' anti-inflammatory properties may also help reduce inflammation in
                the retina, which is believed to play a role in the development of AMO.
            </p>
            <p class="line2">The vitamin C in blueberries supports the health of the lens by neutralizing free radicals
                and
                reducing oxidative stress, a significant contributor to cataract formation. Anthocyanins may also
                protect the lens from UV light damage, which is another contributing factor to cataracts.
            </p>
            <p class="line2">The antioxidants in blueberries may protect the delicate blood vessels in the retina from
                damage due to
                high blood sugar levels. They also help improve circulation and reduce inflammation, which can be
                beneficial for managing and preventing diabetic retinopathy.</p>
