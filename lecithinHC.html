                Lecithin is known to help lower cholesterol levels through several mechanisms related to its ability to
                emulsify fats and enhance lipid metabolism.

                </b>
                <p class="line">Lecithin is rich in phosphatidylcholine, which is a key component of cell membranes,
                    including those in the brain. During pregnancy, the developing fetus relies on the mother's intake
                    of lecithin (and its components, like choline) to support neural development.
                </p>
                <p class="line">Lecithin acts as an emulsifier, breaking down fats into smaller particles in the
                    digestive system. This facilitates efficient fat metabolism and prevents the accumulation of fat in
                    the blood as well as reduced absorption of dietary cholesterol into the bloodstream.</p>

                    <li style="color: rgb(34 169 50);" class="line">Increased HDL (Good Cholesterol) Levels</li>
                </b>
                <p class="line">Lecithin plays a role in the formation of the placenta, the organ that connects the
                    developing baby to the mother's blood supply. The placenta is essential for nutrient and oxygen
                    exchange between mother and baby, and lecithin helps maintain the integrity and function of the
                    placental membranes.
                </p>
                <p class="line">Lecithin promotes the production of
                    high-density lipoprotein (HDL), which helps transport excess cholesterol from the arteries and
                    tissues back to the liver for elimination. By increasing HDL, lecithin supports the body's natural
                    process of clearing excess cholesterol, reducing the risk of arterial plaque buildup.

                </b>
                <p class="line2">Lecithin helps decrease levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, which is
                    the type of cholesterol most associated with plaque formation and cardiovascular disease. It does
                    this by enhancing the liver's ability to metabolize and eliminate LDL cholesterol.</p>
