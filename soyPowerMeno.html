            <p>lsoflavone, together with the herbal ingredients in this product alleviate the signs and symptoms of
                menopause.</p>

                <li>Relieve Hot Flashes</li>
                <p class="line2">Hot flashes are one of the most common and uncomfortable symptoms of menopause, caused
                    by the decline in estrogen levels. lsoflavones can mimic estrogen in the body and help regulate the
                    body's temperature controlcenter in the brain, potentially reducing the frequency and severity of
                    hot flashes.</p>
                <p class="line2">Studies have shown that isoflavones, especially those found in soy (such as genistein
                    and daidzein), can help reduce hot flashes in some women. They may act by interacting with estrogen
                    receptors in a way that alleviates this symptom.</p>
                <li>Mood and Mental Health Support</li>
                <p class="line2">Hormonal fluctuations during menopause can affect mood, leading to symptoms like
                    irritability, anxiety, and depression. lsoflavones may help stabilize mood by interacting with
                    estrogen receptors in the brain, which are involved in the regulation of mood and cognitive
                    function.
                    Some studies suggest that isoflavones may reduce the severity of depressive symptoms during
                    menopause, potentially improving mental well-being.
