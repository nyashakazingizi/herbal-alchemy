            <p>Ganoderma Plus Capsule is rich in antioxidants that help neutralize harmful free radicals that contribute
                to oxidative stress, a process that can damage liver cells and promote the development of cancer.
            </p>
            <p>It also has anti-inflammatory properties
                that help alleviate chronic inflammation, a key factor in the development of liver cancers, especially
                in conditions like cirrhosis or hepatitis.
            </p>
            <p>Ganoderma can increase the activity
                of immune cells like natural killer (NK) cells and T-cells, which play a role in recognizing and
                destroying cancer cells.
            </p>
            <p>There is evidence from preclinical studies that Ganoderma extracts may have direct anti-cancer effects.
                Some studies suggest that Ganoderma lucidum may inhibit the growth of liver cancer cells, either by
                inducing apoptosis in cancer cells or by interfering with the cancer cells' ability to proliferate.</p>
            <p>
                Some studies suggest that Ganoderma might improve the effectiveness of chemotherapy and radiation
                therapy while reducing side effects such as fatigue, immune suppression, and liver toxicity.
