            <p>Zinc is involved in numerous physiological processes that are important for both the mother's and the
                developing baby's health.

            </p>
            <ol>
                <li style="color: rgb(4, 9, 54);">Supports Fetal Growth and Development</li>
                <p class="line2">Zinc is crucial for cellular growth and the proper development of the fetus. It plays a
                    key role in DNA synthesis, cell division, and protein synthesis, which are essential processes for
                    the growth of fetal tissues and organs.</p>
                <p class="line2">Adequate zinc levels during pregnancy are particularly important in the early stages
                    when the baby's cells are rapidly dividing and forming major organs and body systems.</p>
                <li style="color: rgb(4, 9, 54);">Enhances Immune Function</li>
                <p class="line2">Zinc is important for the proper functioning of the immune system. During pregnancy,
                    the immune system undergoes changes to protect both the mother and the fetus.</p>
                <p class="line2">Adequate zinc intake helps support immune defense, reducing the risk of infections and
                    complications for the mother. It can also help the body respond appropriately to infections without
                    overreacting and harming the developing baby.
                </p>
                <li style="color: rgb(4, 9, 54);">Prevents Preterm Birth and Low Birth Weight</li>
                <p class="line2">Zinc is linked to prevention of preterm birth andlow birth weight. Research suggests
                    that adequate zinc intake helps to support proper fetal growth and reduces the risk of these
                    complications.</p>
                <li style="color: rgb(4, 9, 54);">Supports Placental Health</li>
                <p class="line2">Zinc is involved in the development and function of the placenta, the organ that
                    provides nutrients and oxygen to the fetus. Zinc supports the growth and repair of placental
                    tissues, ensuring that it functions properly throughout the pregnancy.</p>
                <p class="line2">A healthy placenta is critical for fetal nourishment and overall pregnancy success, and
                    zinc plays a role in ensuring this vital organ's integrity and performance.</p>
                <li style="color: rgb(4, 9, 54);">Reduces the Risk of Birth Defects</li>
                <p class="line2">Adequate zinc levels during pregnancy may help reduce the risk of certain birth
                    defects, especially those related to neural tube defects (like spina bifida), because zinc is
                    involved in DNA synthesis and cell division during fetal development.</p>
                <p class="line2">Zinc also plays a role in the development of the nervous system, ensuring that the
                    fetal brain and spinal cord form properly.</p>
