                    <li style="color:rgb(34 169 50)">Support for brain cell repair and regeneration</li>
                </b>
                <p class="line2">Lecithin, due to its high phosphatidylcholine content, is essential for the structure
                    and function of cell membranes, including those of brain cells(neurons).After a stroke, brain cells
                    can be damaged, and lecithin may support the repair and regeneration of these cells by improving
                    membrane integrity and function.</p>
                <b>
                    <li style="color:rgb(34 169 50)">Improved brain function and cognitive support</li>
                </b>
                <p class="line2">Phosphatidylcholine, derived from lecithin is a precursor to acetylcholine, a
                    neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in memory, learning, and overall brain function.
                    Acetylcholine deficiency is often associated with cognitive decline, and supplementing with lecithin
                    may help improve cognitive function and memory, which is especially important after a stroke.

                    <li style="color:rgb(34 169 50)">Fat Metabolism and Cholesterol
                        Balance
                    </li>
                </b>
                <p class="line2">Lecithin plays a role in fat metabolism and helps break down fats in the liver. After a
                    stroke, maintaining healthy cholesterol levels is important to reduce the risk of further strokes or
                    cardiovascular problems. Lecithin can help in managing cholesterol and fat metabolism, which may
                    reduce the risk of another stroke.</p>
