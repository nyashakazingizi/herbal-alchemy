                <li style="color:rgb(193, 193, 11);"><b>Accelerates peristalsis of large intestine</b></li>
                <p class="line2">When bowel movements are infrequent, the body may reabsorb some toxins and partially
                    digested materials, which can slow down metabolism. A slower metabolism may lead to reduced
                    calorie-burning efficiency, contributing to weight
                    gain. Through accelerating peristalsis of large intestine, it alleviates constipation and helps
                    clear the wastes and toxins.
                </p>
                <li style="color:rgb(193, 193, 11);"><b>Improves Gut Health</b></li>
                <p class="line2">Clear CJJ Fresh Drink may promote the growth of beneficial gut bacteria, which are
                    linked to improved metabolism and weight regulation. A healthy gut microbiome is crucial for
                    preventing obesity-related metabolic disorders. A healthy gut microbiome is crucial for regulating
                    appetite, energy metabolism, and fat storage. Dysbiosis can lead to increased fat accumulation and
                    difficulties in managing weight.</p>
