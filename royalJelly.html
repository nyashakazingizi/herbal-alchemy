            <p>Royal jelly is a nutrient-rich substance produced by worker bees to feed the queen bee. The connection
                between royal jelly and sexual health is primarily based on its nutrient profile, hormonal influences,
                and traditional uses.</p>

                <li style="color: rgb(215, 134, 34);">Estrogenic Properties</li>
                <p class="line2">Royal jelly contains compounds that can act like phytoestrogens. Estrogen plays a key
                    role in sexual desire and reproductive health in women. By supporting estrogen balance, royal jelly
                    may help improve libido, especially in women experiencing hormonal imbalances (e.g., during
                    menopause).</p>
                <li style="color: rgb(215, 134, 34);">Support Testosterone Levels</li>
                <p class="line2">Royal jelly is believed to support the production of hormones like testosterone, which
                    also play a role in sexual desire. Testosterone is essential for both menand women, and in women, it
                    helps maintain libido and arousal.</p>
                <li style="color: rgb(215, 134, 34);">Fertility and Reproductive Health</li>
                <p class="line2">Royal jelly has been used in traditional medicine to support reproductive health. II is
                    believed to enhance the function of the ovaries, improve egg quality, and balance hormones involved
                    in fertility, such as estrogen and progesterone. Although this is more related to fertility,
                    improved reproductive health can indirectly support a healthier libido.</p>
