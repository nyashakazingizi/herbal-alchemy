            <p>The herbal ingredients in this product nurture kidney meridian, which, in TCM, is considered a key energy
                channel that influences vitality, sexual health, and overall reproductive function.
                According to TCM, the kidneys are associated with life force (Qi) and essence (Jing), which are crucial
                for sexual health.

            <ol>
                <li style="color: rgb(33, 55, 226);">ENHANCE VITAL ENERGY (QI)</li>
                <p class="line2">The kidney meridian is believed to store Qi, which is vital for overall energy levels,
                    including
                    sexual energy. By stimulating this meridian, ii may help increase stamina, energy, and sexual
                    desire.</p>
                <li style="color: rgb(33, 55, 226);">BALANCE HORMONES</li>
                <p class="line2">The kidneys in TCM are closely tied to reproductive health and hormonal balance.
                    Strengthening the
                    kidney meridian can support the body's natural hormone production, including those related to sexual
                    health.</p>
                <li style="color: rgb(33, 55, 226);">NOURISH ESSENCE (JING)</li>
                <p class="line2">Jing, which is stored in the kidneys, is considered the foundation of life and vitality
                    in TCM. A
                    depletion of Jing is thought to contribute to low libido and sexual dysfunction. Practices that
                    stimulate the kidney meridian, such as acupuncture or herbal remedies, may help preserve or restore
                    Jing, potentially improving sexual desire.</p>
