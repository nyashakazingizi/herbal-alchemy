            <p>
                One of the hallmarks of CKD is the buildup of waste products in the blood due to impaired kidney
                function. These waste products, also known as uremic toxins, can contribute to symptoms like fatigue,
                nausea, and itching, and can also exacerbate kidney damage.

            </p>
            <p>Chitosan has been shown to have adsorptive properties, meaning it can bind to toxins in the digestive
                tract and help remove them from the body. This action may reduce the levels of harmful substances in the
                blood that the kidneys would normally filter.
            </p>
            <p>Some studies suggest that chitosan may reduce the levels of urea, creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen
                (BUN)-key markers of kidney function-by helping to eliminate toxins through the gastrointestinal tract
                instead of relying entirely on the kidneys.</p>
