            <p>The herbal ingredients in this product nurture kidney meridian, which, in TCM, is considered a key energy
                channel that influences vitality, sexual health, and overall reproductive function.
                According to TCM, the kidneys are associated with life force (Qi) and essence (Jing), which are crucial
                for sexual health.

                <p class="line2">In TCM, Jing is considered a vital substance that influences sexual health, fertility,
                    and overall vitality. It is believed to be particularly important in female health, as it governs
                    the menstrual cycle, ovarian function, and childbearing potential.</p>
                <li style="color: rgb(33, 55, 226);">Kidney and Hormones</li>
                <p class="line2">The Kidneys are linked to the endocrine system in TCM, which includes the hormones that
                    regulate various bodily functions, including reproductive health. Therefore, any disruption in
                    kidney Qi or Essence can affect female hormonal balance, menstrual cycles, and fertility.</p>
