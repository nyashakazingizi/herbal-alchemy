            <p>Lecithin can provide several benefits during pregnancy due to its role in supporting various
                physiological processes, including brain development, cell membrane integrity, and overall maternal
                health.

                <li style="color: rgb(34 169 50);" class="line">Supports Brain and Nervous System Development</li>
                <p class="line">Lecithin is rich in phosphatidylcholine, which is a key component of cell membranes,
                    including those in the brain. During pregnancy, the developing fetus relies on the mother's intake
                    of lecithin (and its components, like choline) to support neural development.
                </p>
                <p class="line">Choline, which is present in lecithin, is a precursor to acetylcholine, a
                    neurotransmitter important
                    for brain development and cognitive function. Adequate levels of choline are essential for the
                    proper development of the fetal brain, spinal cord, and nervous system, particularly in the early
                    stages of pregnancy when these systems are forming.</p>
                <li style="color: rgb(34 169 50);" class="line">Supports Placental Function</li>
                <p class="line">Lecithin plays a role in the formation of the placenta, the organ that connects the
                    developing baby to the mother's blood supply. The placenta is essential for nutrient and oxygen
                    exchange between mother and baby, and lecithin helps maintain the integrity and function of the
                    placental membranes.
                </p>
                <p class="line">Lecithin, through its phospholipid
                    components, also helps in the structural development of the placental cells, ensuring that they
                    function effectively in nutrient transfer.
