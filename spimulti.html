            <ul>
                <li>Tryptophan is a precursor to serotonin, the "feel-good" neurotransmitte Tyrosine is a precursor
                    to dopamine and norepinephrine, neurotransmitters that affect mood, motivation, and focus. Adequate
                    levels or these amino acids can help balance mood.</li>
                <li>B vitamins, including B6, B12, and folate
                    (B9), are involved in brain function, mood regulation, and energy production.
                    Deficiencies in these vitamins have been linked to depressive symptoms.
                </li>
                <li>A deficiency in vitamin D has been linked to an increased risk of depression. Vitamin D helps
                    regulate mood and supports the production of neurotransmitters.</li>
                <li>Magnesium helps regulate the stress
                    response and supports neurotransmitter function. Low magnesium levels have been linked to symptoms
                    of depression, anxiety, and irritability.
                </li>
                <li>Zinc is involved in the functioning of neurotransmitters and has antioxidant properties. Studies
                    suggest that people with depression often have lower levels or zinc, and supplementation may improve
                    depressive symptoms.</li>
