            <p>The kidneys play a crucial role in bone formation and overall bone health due to their involvement in
                several key processes that regulate calcium, phosphate, and vitamin D metabolism.

                <p class="line2">In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), the kidney meridian plays a central role in
                    maintaining overall health, vitality, and youthfulness. TCM views the kidneys not just as organs but
                    as a source of vital energy (Qi) and essence (Jing), which are fundamental to life and longevity.
                </p>
                <li style="color: rgb(33, 55, 226);">The Role in Aging</li>
                <p class="line2">In TCM, aging is seen as the gradual depletion of the body's essence. The kidneys are
                    considered the most important organ for slowing this process because they store the primordial
                    essence that governs longevity. Supporting kidney health is believed to slow the physical and mental
                    declines associated with aging, prolonging vitality and maintaining health for longer.</p>
