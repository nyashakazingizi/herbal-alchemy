            <p>
                This product is rich in vitamins, minerals, protein, essential fatty acids as well as phytonutrients
                such as polyphenols, flavonoids and -carotene.

                <li style="color:rgb(90, 5, 187)">Anti-inflammatory and antioxidative Properties</li>
                <p class="line2">These nutrients have anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties that help protect
                    the body from oxidative stress and free radical damage, which can arise from environmental factors,
                    normal metabolic processes, and increased demands during pregnancy.</p>
                <p class="line2">Oxidative stress can negatively impact both
                    maternal and fetal health, so getting sufficient antioxidants is vital to reduce these risks.
                </p>
                <li style="color:rgb(90, 5, 187)">Supports digestive health</li>
                <p class="line2">This product is rich in fructo-Oligosaccharides (FOS), which are a type of prebiotic
                    fiber that can support digestive health, improve gut flora, and provide other health benefits.</p>
                <p class="line2">Pregnancy often leads to digestive issues like constipation, bloating, and indigestion.
                    FOS act as a prebiotic, which means they serve as food for beneficial gut bacteria. These beneficial
                    bacteria, in turn, support healthy digestion.</p>
                <p class="line2">FOS can help improve bowel regularity and reduce the discomfort of constipation, which
                    is a common issue during pregnancy due to hormonal changes and pressure on the intestines from the
                    growing uterus.</p>
                <li style="color:rgb(90, 5, 187)">Promotes Healthy Gut Flora</li>
                <p class="line2">A healthy balance of gut bacteria is crucial for immune function, digestion, and
                    overall health. FOS promote the growth of beneficial bacteria like Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli,
                    which can help maintain a balanced gut microbiome.</p>
                <p class="line2">A healthy gut microbiome has been associated with better immune function, which is
                    important during pregnancy, as the immune system is somewhat suppressed to avoid rejecting the
                    fetus.</p>
