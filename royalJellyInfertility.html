        <div class="info">
            <p>Royal jelly is a nutrient-rich substance produced by worker bees to feed the queen bee. The connection
                between royal jelly and sexual health is primarily based on its nutrient profile, hormonal influences,
                and traditional uses.</p>

            <ol>
                <li style="color: rgb(215, 134, 34);">Supports Estrogen Production</li>
                <p class="line2">Royal jelly contains phytoestrogens, which are plant compounds that mimic the action of
                    estrogen, the primary female sex hormone.</p>
                <p class="line2">These phytoestrogens can bind to estrogen
                    receptors in the body, promoting estrogen-like effects. This is particularly helpful for women who
                    experience estrogen deficiency due to factors like menopause or hormonal imbalances.
                </p>
                <li style="color: rgb(215, 134, 34);">Promotes Ovarian Health</li>
                <p class="line2">Studies in animals have shown that royal jelly can enhance ovarian activity and improve
                    follicular development (the maturation of eggs). This may be beneficial for women trying to conceive
                    or undergoing fertility treatments.</p>
                <p class="line2">Royal jelly contains high levels of vitamin 85
                    (pantolhenic acid), which is involved in the production of hormones like estrogen and progesterone,
                    further supporting ovarian health.
                </p>
                <li style="color: rgb(215, 134, 34);">Regulates Hormonal Balance</li>
                <p class="line2">By supporting the pituitary gland, which controls the release of hormones like FSH
                    (follicle-stimulating hormone) and LH (luteinizing hormone), royal jelly may help regulate the
                    menstrual cycle and improve ovulation.</p>
